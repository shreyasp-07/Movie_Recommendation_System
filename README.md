# Movie_Recommendation_System
Recommender System is a system that seeks to predict/filter preferences according to the user's choices. 
These systems are utilized in variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. 
Recommendar systems produce a list of recommendation in any two ways-
1. Collaborative filtering: This approaches build a model from user's past behaviour.(i.e. items purchased or searched by user) as well as similar desicions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that users may have an interest in.
2. Content-based filtering: This approaches uses a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties. This filtering methods are totally based on description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences. It recommends items based on the user's past preferences. Let's develop a basic recommendation system using python and Pandas.
